# 🍽️ AI Recipe Recommender

This project was developed as part of the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course.  
Its goal is to provide smart recipe recommendations based on user-selected ingredients and preferences using content-based filtering.

---

## 📌 Project Description

We built a **Content-Based Recommendation System** that suggests recipes similar to a selected one.  
The algorithm considers:

- Cuisine Type  
- User Rating  
- Cooking Time  
- Popularity Score  

It filters and ranks recipes based on similarity using statistical proximity logic.

## 🤖 AI Elements Used

Although no machine learning models were trained, we implemented a valid **AI recommendation approach**:
- Content-Based Filtering
- Similarity analysis based on structured attributes
- Rule-based logic simulating intelligent behavior

This methodology is a part of **Knowledge-Based Systems** in AI.
